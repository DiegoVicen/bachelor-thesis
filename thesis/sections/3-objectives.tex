\section{Objectives}

The main goal of this project is to develop a complete framework for Haskell,
containing the following parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{A Heuristic Search library}: Arguably, the most complex part of
  the framework. This library would include a set of both uninformed and
  informed algorithms that have been adapted to the functional paradigm from
  their traditional implementations. Apart from the algorithms, the library
  will also provide the necessary building blocks for designing a new
  algorithm. These building blocks will be in fact used in the algorithms of
  the library, so the user can get a better intuition on how to use them just
  by checking the source code. There will be, in fact, two complementary
  libraries: one of them will implement the algorithms in a pure way, offering
  fast and completely functional executions; while the other will offer the
  same algorithms using a monad that will collect different execution metrics,
  and will be specially interesting for educational purposes on the algorithms.
\item \textbf{The automation and benchmarking tools}: To offer a useful
  framework, it has to allow researchers to be able to perform batch
  experiments, as well as provide tools for benchmarking the code looking for
  possible performance improvements. That way, the framework will include
  several shortcuts for performing tests and comparisons between algorithm, as
  well as integration with benchmarking and optimization tools available for
  Haskell.
\item \textbf{Toy problems and other examples}: A small number of typical
  problems already implemented in Haskell, ready for the user to test or solve
  with the algorithms proposed (or developed).
\item \textbf{Tutorial, examples and documentation}: Due to the complexity and
  novelty of this framework, a comprehensive set of documentation has to be
  generated, and examples of use as well as several tutorials are planned to be
  written for the users to better understand how the library works
\end{enumerate}
