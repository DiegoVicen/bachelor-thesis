\section{Documentation}

This appendix includes a PDF version of the documentation for the library. This
documentation is generated by Cabal using the \texttt{haddock} tool. Its LaTeX
backend is, however, deprecated; so this document has been generated as a PDF
from the HTML documentation available online for the library. The reason for
this clarification is to beware warn the reader and apologize for any possible
graphical artifacts that may have been included in this process.\\

The documentation includes the comprehensive description of all the functions
provided in all the modules of the package, being them described in
alphabetical order. This order is the one followed in the library index as
well, that may serve as a possible reference. If the reader is using a PDF
version of this thesis, please notice that all the hyperlinks were dropped in
the conversion to the adequate format, and it is recommended to check the
online version of the documentation for ease of use.\\
