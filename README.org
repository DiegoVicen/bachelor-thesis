This repository contains the code to generate the my Bachelor Thesis document:
/Agis: Heuristic Search Library & Framework in Haskell/. In this document, it
is comprehensively detailed the inception, design and implementation process of
an heuristic search library from a pure functional programming point of view.
The document is generated via LaTeX and can be obtained running:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd thesis
pdflatex tfg.tex
#+END_SRC
